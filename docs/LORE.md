# Claim - Game Lore & Setting

## Technology: Fusion Drives

Your ships use **deuterium-helium3 fusion drives** - the standard for commercial spaceflight in the 22nd century. These engines provide:
- **Constant thrust** over days/weeks (no coasting periods)
- **High efficiency** (~100,000s ISP) but still mass-limited
- **Reliable operation** in deep space with minimal maintenance

The "fuel" you purchase is **fusion propellant** - a mixture of deuterium and helium-3 that gets expelled as superheated plasma. While the fusion reaction provides energy, you still need reaction mass to create thrust, which is why fuel is a consumable resource.

## Fuel Economy & Sources

### Earth Orbital Depots - Cheapest Production, Expensive Distribution

**What they produce:**
- **Deuterium**: Extracted from Earth's oceans (essentially unlimited supply)
- **Helium-3**: Mined from lunar regolith by automated surface operations
- **Processing**: Refined at L1 orbital facilities, shipped to LEO depots

**Pricing model:**
- **Base cost**: $5/unit (cheapest production in the solar system)
- **Shipping cost**: +$1.20/unit per AU from Earth
- **Example**: At Earth = $5/unit, at 3 AU = $8.60/unit, at 5 AU = $11/unit

**Why it gets expensive:** Distribution costs dominate. Every fuel unit shipped to distant operations pays interplanetary freight.

### Colonies - Local Production, Higher Base Cost, No Shipping

**Strategic locations:** Colonies are built AT water-rich asteroids/comets specifically for fuel independence
- **Local ice mining**: Colonies extract water ice from their own asteroid/parent body
- **You mine metals, they mine ice**: You bring iron/platinum to sell, they produce fuel locally
- **Helium-3**: Shipped from Luna (expensive) or harvested from nearby gas giants (rare)

**Pricing model:**
- **Base cost**: $6.50/unit (higher than Earth due to smaller scale, frontier conditions)
- **Local price**: $6.50/unit if docked at colony
- **Shipping**: +$1.20/unit per AU if fuel delivered elsewhere

**Why colonies matter:**
- At 1.5 AU from Earth: Colony fuel = $6.50/unit vs Earth fuel = $6.80/unit (slight savings)
- At 3 AU from Earth: Colony fuel = $6.50/unit vs Earth fuel = $8.60/unit (25% savings)
- At 5 AU from Earth: Colony fuel = $6.50/unit vs Earth fuel = $11/unit (40% savings!)

This is the economic foundation for colonial independence - local fuel production breaks Earth's distribution monopoly.

### Future Technology (Not Yet Implemented)

**Fuel Processor Equipment** - Planned for late-game
- **Function**: Extract deuterium from comet ice or asteroid volatiles
- **Speed**: Very slow (days to refuel), but enables true frontier operations
- **Use case**: Ships operating beyond the colonies, in Kuiper Belt, etc.
- **Tradeoff**: Takes an equipment slot, reduces mining efficiency

## Why Gravity Assists Matter

Even with fusion drives, **propellant is expensive**. A gravity assist around Mars or Jupiter:
- Provides "free" delta-v by trading momentum with the planet's orbit
- Saves 15-40% of fuel costs on long-haul routes
- Makes economical sense despite longer flight times
- Essential for operations in the outer system where fuel is scarce

Your company's **thrust policy** determines when to use slingshots:
- **Conservative/Economical**: Use them frequently (safety/profit)
- **Aggressive**: Direct routes (time is money)
- **Balanced**: Optimize fuel vs time based on proximity to refueling

## The Economics - Why Regional Operations Win

**Scenario 1: Earth Shuttle Service** (Beginner mistake)
- Mine at Vesta (2.36 AU), return to Earth every trip
- Fuel cost: ~$7.80/unit each way (average)
- Result: High fuel costs eat into profits

**Scenario 2: Regional Operation** (Profitable strategy)
- Mine at Vesta (2.36 AU), sell at nearby Ceres colony (2.77 AU, 0.41 AU away)
- Fuel cost: ~$6.50/unit from Ceres depot
- Result: Lower fuel costs, faster turnaround, higher profit margin

**Scenario 3: Outer System Expansion** (Advanced play)
- Mine Jupiter trojans (5.2 AU), sell at colony in that region
- Fuel cost: $6.50/unit locally vs $11/unit if shipped from Earth
- Result: Colonies enable profitable operations that would be impossible with Earth logistics

**Strategic implications:**
- **Early game**: Operate near Earth, fuel is reasonably cheap ($5-7/unit)
- **Mid game**: Establish regional routes around colonies (best fuel prices)
- **Late game**: Colonies become essential fuel hubs for outer system operations
- **Gravity assists**: Save 15-40% on fuel = significant profit boost, especially in outer system

This is why experienced operators keep ships working regionally rather than constantly returning to Earth - the fuel economics favor local trade and gradual expansion. Colonies aren't just markets, they're the logistical backbone that makes distant operations viable.

*Note: As your company expands, you may invest in fuel processing equipment, establish fuel depots at key locations, or even contract with Jupiter atmosphere harvesters for He-3 supplies. The fuel economy is as much a game mechanic as the mining itself.*
